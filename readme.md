### Try customising
Try customising and playing with the code to improve the looks and performance of the simulation.

You can try controlling the model without having to go into the code using the top-right dat.gui menu. It is closed by default, you can click on the button that says 'Close Controls' to open the controls. In case controls aren't working well, try another browser.
